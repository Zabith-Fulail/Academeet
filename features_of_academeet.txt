Design features for the Student app (what it should eventually do).

Simulate/mock data locally so you can continue building the UI and flows without waiting for backend.

Keep your architecture clean so swapping to real API later will be smooth.

Here’s a structured feature + development guide for the Student App:

🎯 Core Features for Student App (Phase 1 – Without Backend)

You can simulate these with local JSON files, dummy lists, or mock services.

1. Authentication (simulated)

Screens: Login, Signup, Forgot Password.

For now → just check against a dummy hardcoded list or local JSON.

Later → integrate Firebase/Auth backend.

2. Browse Tutors

Screen: Tutor List + Tutor Profile.

Show tutor cards with photo, subjects, rating, availability.

Use mock data (JSON file or Dart list). Example:

[
  {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "subject": "Math", "rating": 4.8},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Sarah Lee", "subject": "Physics", "rating": 4.5}
]

3. Search & Filter Tutors

Filter by subject, availability, price, rating.

Implement using list filtering in local state.

4. Booking a Session

Screens: Select Tutor → Select Date/Time → Confirm.

Simulate booking by storing in local storage (SharedPreferences / Hive).

Later → connect to backend scheduling API.

5. Session Management

Upcoming Sessions tab.

Past Sessions/History tab.

Store locally → so you can see “dummy booked sessions”.

6. Chat/Communication (Simulated)

Add a simple chat UI with dummy data (like WhatsApp style).

Later integrate with real-time backend (Firebase/Socket).

7. Payment Flow (Mock)

Show “Choose payment method” and simulate success/failure.

Later integrate with Stripe/PayPal API.

8. Profile & Settings

Student profile (Name, Email, Subjects of interest).

App settings (notifications, theme, logout).

⚙️ How to Simulate Locally (No Backend Yet)

You’ll need a mock layer in your project:

Mock Data Source

Store JSON files in /assets/mock/ or create static lists.

Example: tutors.json, bookings.json.

Repository Pattern

Define repositories like TutorRepository, BookingRepository.

For now → return data from mock JSON.

Later → swap to API calls (Dio/Retrofit).

Local Persistence

Use Hive or SharedPreferences to store mock bookings, chat messages, session history.

Dummy States

Example: when booking a tutor → add a booking to local state, display in “Upcoming Sessions”.

📌 Development Order (Recommended)

So you don’t get stuck:

Authentication UI (dummy login)

Home Dashboard (search tutors, popular tutors)

Tutor List + Profile Screen

Booking Flow (select time, confirm)

Upcoming/History Sessions

Chat Screen (static messages)

Profile & Settings

Payment Mock Flow

🚀 What This Gives You

A fully working student app prototype (with dummy data).

You can test all user journeys locally.

Once backend APIs are live → just replace mock repositories with API repositories.
